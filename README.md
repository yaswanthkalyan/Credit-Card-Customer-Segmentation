# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation

This project focuses on Credit Card Customer Clustering, a pivotal aspect for credit card companies aiming to refine personalized marketing, conduct effective risk assessments, and bolster customer retention. Employing advanced data mining techniques, specifically clustering algorithms, our project aims to automatically categorize credit card customers into distinct groups based on shared traits, behaviors, and preferences. The project encompasses key objectives, including dataset pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with diverse visualizations, clustering implementation, assessment of clustering results, and visualization of outcomes. Utilizing the Customer Credit Card (CCC) dataset from Kaggle, containing behavioral variables of approximately 9,000 credit card holders, this project aspires to provide actionable insights that empower credit card companies in making informed decisions and optimizing resource utilization.![image](https://github.com/yaswanthkalyan/Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation/assets/44950487/44062e67-0290-4d62-bc63-8a05ff80212e)
